    "about": "Hello! I’m Alena, a full-stack web developer with over four years of experience, specializing in building engaging and efficient web applications. I originally started my career in linguistics, but in 2020, I followed my curiosity and passion for tech by completing a web development bootcamp. The transition was life-changing, and I’ve been captivated by the world of development ever since.\nSince then, I've worked both as a freelancer and as a frontend developer for a prominent Austrian online platform, where I contributed to creating intuitive, high-quality digital experiences. My background in linguistics gives me a unique perspective on communication in design and coding, enabling me to think through user experiences from diverse viewpoints and build solutions that are both user-friendly and technically sound.\nIn addition to my professional work, I'm an avid traveler and a passionate dancer, constantly seeking inspiration from different cultures and creative outlets. When I’m not coding or exploring new places, you can often find me on the dance floor or planning my next adventure.\nMy approach to life? It’s all about balance—and yes, that includes occasionally devouring an entire pizza solo.",
